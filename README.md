## PREDICTION OF POLITICAL ORIENTATION BY EMPLOYING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
This research explores under-investigated terrain in political alignment prediction by focusing on Reddit, a platform that has remained largely sidelined in favor of more mainstream social media like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. While previous studies have extensively used Twitter data to predict users' political leanings, Reddit—despite being data-rich and politically active—has received significantly less attention.

This study addresses key gaps in the current literature:

## Research Objectives
Platform-Specific Prediction
Can Reddit user data be effectively used to predict political alignment, and how does it perform in comparison to Twitter?

Cross-Platform Prediction
What is the predictive performance of a machine learning model when it is trained on one platform (e.g., Twitter) and tested on another (e.g., Reddit)?

Multi-Platform Training
How does combining data from both Reddit and Twitter affect prediction performance, and which model performs best in this hybrid setup?

By examining these questions, the project aims to broaden the scope of political preference prediction by incorporating cross-platform and multi-source data strategies—areas that have largely been overlooked in current research.

## Features
Comparative analysis between Reddit and Twitter as data sources

Cross-platform prediction models

Evaluation of hybrid training on merged datasets

Performance benchmarking across multiple machine learning algorithms
